# my-recipes

I will demonstrate my HTML fundamentals in this small project by creating my recipes.

This will involve:
1. Write headings, paragraphs, and bodies of my recipes.
2. Create links and images.

By the end of this project, I will be able to:
1. Demonstrate my understanding of version control systems (GIT).
   - git clone, git pull, git push
   - synchronize my local machine with the remote repositories 
2. Demonstrate my HTML fundamentals.
